## 2.2.2 - 2025-08-04

### Changed

-   nPM1300:
    -   Battery current limits (IBATLIM) have been lowered. High is now set at
        1000 mA (previously 1370 mA) and low is now set at 200 mA (previously
        270 mA).
    -   Maximum battery capacity allowed has been increased to 3000 mAh
        (previously 800 mAh).

### Fixed

-   Issue where the charging current limit (ICHG) would only allow even numbers
    when profiling a battery on the nPM1304 EK. This has been fixed to allow all
    values in the range from 4 to 100 mA.
-   Issue where the option for adding or editing a battery profile would only
    accept battery capacity values between 32 and 3000 mAh for the nPM1304 EK.
    This has been fixed to allow all values in the range from 4 mAh to 3000 mAh.
