_nRF Connect nM PowerUP_ is a desktop application intended to work with the
nPM1300 EK to allow customers to quickly and efficiently evaluate the nPM1300
PMIC for their projects. Once connected to an EK, the app gives full control
over the adjustable settings of the nPM1300 PMIC. Using the included battery
models, you can also get an estimated time-to-full and time-to-empty when
charging or discharging a battery connected to the EK.
