nRF Connect nPM PowerUP is a desktop application intended to work with the
nPM1300 EK to allow customers to quickly and efficiently evaluate the nPM1300
PMIC for their projects.

Once connected to an EK, the app gives full control over the adjustable settings
of the nPM1300 PMIC. Using the included battery models, you can also get an
estimated time-to-full and time-to-empty when charging or discharging a battery
connected to the EK.
