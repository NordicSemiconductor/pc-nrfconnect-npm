# {{app_name}}

The {{app_name}} is a desktop application intended to work with the Power Management Integrated Circuit (PMIC) devices from Nordic Semiconductor to allow customers to quickly and efficiently evaluate the PMIC for their projects.

Once connected to an Evaluation Kit (EK), the app gives full control over the adjustable settings of the PMIC. Using the included battery models, you can also get an estimated time-to-full and time-to-empty when charging or discharging a battery connected to the EK.

The {{app_name}} is installed and updated using [nRF Connect for Desktop](https://docs.nordicsemi.com/bundle/nrf-connect-desktop/page/index.html).

## Supported devices
